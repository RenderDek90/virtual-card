# Virtual Card

Virtual Card project is a simple project for Codepolitan to deepen my ReactJS knowledge and gain hands-on experience with React Components, Hooks, State Management, and other necessary features.

The Virtual card has a little description about me, my own motto, and my skills, with my whatsapp and github links
